## Evaluating snow accumulation through the application of ibutton temperature sensors, 2023_NoahL

### Introduction

Through this project, I hoped to gauge the snow depth at a static altitude during 2022 and 2023. By utilizing data collected from iButton temperature sensor arrays where each sensor is at a different height, snow accumulation can be roughly evaluated since the sensors do not experience temperature oscillations when covered by a layer of snow. This data can be extremely valuable, as it can illustrate the devastating effects of climate change on snow precipitation which is vital for the surrounding ecosystem and human population. 

Programs can be found in the "ESR-LSRI" folder. 
* mtBakerParser - parses Mt. Baker data as well as SNOTEL data and plots it. Requires a specific directory structure to function. More details are in that folder.
* graphIButtonData - graphs specifically iButton data.

Program outputs can be found in the "figures" folder. 
* graphic.png - a simple explanation of my data
* alldataclean.png - iButton snow depth data and SNOTEL data
* justibutton.png - iButton snow depth data
* temp.png - iButton temperature data

Infographic and more information can be found in "docs".

Anaconda environment was used for executing Python scripts.

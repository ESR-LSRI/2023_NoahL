### Evaluating snow accumulation through the application of ibutton temperature sensors

Through this project, I hoped to gauge the snow depth at a static altitude during 2022 and 2023. By utilizing data collected from iButton temperature sensor arrays where each sensor is at a different height, snow accumulation can be roughly evaluated since the sensors do not experience temperature oscillations when covered by a layer of snow. This data can be extremely valuable, as it can illustrate the devastating effects of climate change on snow precipitation which is vital for the surrounding ecosystem and human population. 

Programs can be found in the "ESR-LSRI" folder. Program outputs can be found in the "figures" folder. Infographic and more information can be found in "docs".

Anaconda environment was used for executing Python scripts.

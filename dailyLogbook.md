# Daily Logbook for Noah LIsin

## Date: Topic(s) of the day

Your daily log book should include the following contents:
* Questions you were asking/tasks you needed to complete
* Details on your approach to those questions/task
* A summary of outcomes (e.g. answers, numbers, graphs, intermediate products)
* Your next steps
* Questions you have for your peer(s) and/or instructor(s) 

*each of the topics below should contain a complete summary as detailed above*

This is a [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). Thanks for learning this!

## 7/10/2023 Mt. Baker Climate

### Summary
My main objective for today was to educate myself on the climate of the Pacific Northwest and specifically, Mt. Baker. 

### Approach
Using the resources provided in the README file in this repository, I gained a solid understanding of Mt. Baker and its climate. I then furthered my knowledge through some more curated searches to answer some specific questions I had.

### Outcome
Significant points I discovered through my research:
* The pacific northwest is subject to mild to cold climates due to the cold ocean wind that settles to the west of the Cascades and the Rockies.
* Glacial runoff from the snow on Mt. Baker is extremely important for the preservation of wildlife, crops, and to temper [wildfires].
* By 2070, there may be no snowpack on Mt. Baker due to climate change.
* Lapse rate can be utilized by meteorologists to predict the weather; for instance, precipitation and snowfall.
* Evergreen trees are used as inexpensive cosmic radiation shields in order to obtain accurate temperature measurements.
* The IButton temperature sensors can additionally be used to calculate snowfall.
* Lapse rate can be positive during nighttime when the ground is cooler than the atmosphere. (The ground radiates energy toward space)
* Lapse rate is higher when it's dry around summer.
* Buried IButtons give 0C when snow is melting since that is the melting point. (The ground and air is heating it)

### Next Steps
Begin to analyze data on the lapse rate, sunlight, and snowfall on [Mt. Baker.]

### Questions
N/a
[wildfires]: # (also the source of our electricity from the skagit river.)
[less snowmelt]: # (less than what? be specific here about what you are comparing to)
[Mt. Baker]: # (sounds like you are ready to start asking questions of the data. I will coach you all into the data set and where to start.) 

## 7/11/2023 Mt. Baker Climate

### Summary
My main objective for today was to continue educating myself on the climate of the Pacific Northwest and specifically, Mt. Baker. 

### Approach
I began to focus my attention on a specific question: How sunny is it at Schrieber's Meadow (the lowest instrument site)? Has this changed over the instrument record? I used the scientific papers in the README file, specifically the one on using evergreen trees as radiation shields to begin to understand how I should parse my data.

### Outcome
I updated my notes on Mt. Baker from yesterday, using points noted in the teaching session with Dr. Town. (See [notes]#(7/10/2023-mt.-baker-climate))
I began to write a program that will parse data from all 5 years and take the difference between the sensors in the open and the sensors under the trees to find the "sunniness" without radiation interference. 

### Next Steps
Finish my program, and make conclusions about the results.

## 7/10/2023 Mt. Baker Climate

### Summary
My main objective for today was to educate myself on the climate of the Pacific Northwest and specifically, Mt. Baker. 

### Approach
Using the resources provided in the README file in this repository, I gained a solid understanding of Mt. Baker and its climate. I then furthered my knowledge through some more curated searches to answer some specific questions I had.

### Outcome
Significant points I discovered through my research:
* The pacific northwest is subject to mild to cold climates due to the cold ocean wind that settles to the west of the Cascades and the Rockies.
* Glacial runoff from the snow on Mt. Baker is extremely important for the preservation of wildlife, crops, and to temper [wildfires].
* By 2070, there may be no snowpack on Mt. Baker due to climate change.
* Small lapse rates indicate [less snowmelt], which is why it's important to measure it.

### Next Steps
Begin to analyze data on the lapse rate and sunlight on [Mt. Baker.]

### Questions
N/a

[wildfires]: # (also the source of our electricity from the skagit river.)
[less snowmelt]: # (less than what? be specific here about what you are comparing to)
[Mt. Baker]: # (sounds like you are ready to start asking questions of the data. I will coach you all into the data set and where to start.)
